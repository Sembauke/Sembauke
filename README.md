Welcome to my page, I am Sem and working remotely at freeCodeCamp from The Netherlands. 

I Started my journey at freeCodeCamp back in 2021, where I started working on the freeCodeCamp mobile app. To make coding more accessible to everyone. Nowadays I mostly work on the main platform! Where I do all kinds of tasks to make learning more enjoyable.
