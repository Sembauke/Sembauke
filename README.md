### Thank you for dropping by ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Sem. 
I'm currently based in the Netherlands and contribute to the mission at freeCodeCamp.

My professional journey started in mobile development, with a strong focus on Flutter and Dart. Alongside, I've built a solid foundation in JavaScript and web technologies, enabling me to navigate both front-end and back-end development landscapes.

Recently, I've shifted my focus towards full-stack development, aiming to bridge the gap between server-side logic and front-end presentation. My goal is to make learning accessible to everyone, leveraging my full-stack capabilities to create comprehensive, user-friendly solutions.

I am passionate about education and believe in using my skills for a greater purpose. Continuous learning and applying my knowledge to meaningful projects are at the core of my professional ethos.
